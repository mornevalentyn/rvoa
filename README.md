# rvoa
Source Code for RVOA honours project
 
 Written and tested on windows 10.
 
 Make sure to have apache and php for windows installed. 
 
 Download and install mongoDB, instructions can be found on their website.
 
 Download and install the driver for mongoDB for php.
 
 Download and install ffmpeg and then add the path to the bin folder of FFMPEG to your path variables.
 
 After this the code should be ready to work :)
 
 Remember before running the code, you need to start MongoDB:
 Open command prompt and change directory (cd) to the bin folder located inside the MongoDB folder. 
 (most times its path\MongoDB\Server\[version]\bin)
 Once there you can start up the database with the following command
 
 mongod --dbpath "[path to database folder here]"
 
 hint: the database folder in this case is the data\db folder located in this repo.
